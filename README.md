Introduction:
The California House Price Prediction project aims to develop a machine learning model capable of accurately predicting house prices in various regions of California. By leveraging historical housing data, demographic information, and geographical features, the goal is to create a predictive model to perfom better than the local agents and existing systems.

Dataset:
The project utilizes a comprehensive dataset containing information about housing attributes such as Latitude,Longitude,Housing Median Age,Total Bedrooms,Total Rooms,Population,Households,Median Income,Ocean Proximity,Income Category and Median House Value.

Exploratory Data Analysis:
By performing various statistical tests we have a look at the various attributes in the dataset,we make use of visulisation techniques such as histograms to see the distribution of data.

Train Test Split:
Once we have an idea about the data we split the data into training and test set using shuffled split.

Visualising Data:
The data is againg visualised using histogramn and the geographic data is plotted in the grid to see the distribution of the categories.

Correlation Matrix:
The correlation of all the attributes is obtained,by using a heat map we can conclude which of it is an important attribute for prediction of house prices.

Data Preprocessing:
Before training the machine learning model, extensive data preprocessing is performed to clean, normalize, and transform the raw data. This includes handling missing values this can be done by dropping null values or dropping the particular column with null values but these two methosd may lead to loss of data therefore we will be filling the null values with median values.
Encoding the categorical values such as ocean proximity helps in later model building.
Feature Engineering is performed.
Scaling the values to show that higher numer doesnt mean its an important feature

Pipeline:
Now a pipleline to perform all the above preprocessing tasks is built.

Model Development:
Several machine learning algorithms such as Linear Regression,Decision Tree Regressor and Random Forest Regressor are explored and evaluated to determine the most suitable model for predicting house prices. Hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation techniques such as GridSearchCV is employed to optimize the performance of the selected model. Additionally, ensemble methods may be utilized to combine the predictions of multiple models for improved accuracy and robustness.

Evaluation Metrics:
The performance of the machine learning model is assessed using appropriate evaluation metrics such as Root-Mean-Square Error.

Conclusion:
The California House Price Prediction project is a thorough effort to create a dependable and accurate machine learning model for predicting house prices in California. The project's goal is to deliver important insights and decision support tools to individuals and organizations participating in the real estate market by employing innovative algorithms, robust data pretreatment techniques, and rigorous evaluation methodologies.
